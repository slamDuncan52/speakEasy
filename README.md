A Twilio based nodejs server for remote SMS command execution

This is in absolute alpha right now, and is HORRIBLY insecure.
Suggestions and contributions are welcome, but please be wary
of using it in the wild.

#Usage
1. Start ngrok
2. Start the node server
3. Text!

#TODO
- Set up Twiml to handle incoming messages
- Export server to public web (For free if at all possible)
- Set up textCommand to update and pass environement variables for 
  subsequent requests
